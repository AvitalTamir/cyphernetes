This file tracks the implementation progress with detailed notes about what was done, challenges faced, and solutions applied.

## Implementation Timeline

### Session 1 - 2025-07-18
**Started**: Initial planning and implementation

**Tasks Completed:**
1. ‚úÖ Created memory system for tracking project progress
2. ‚úÖ Documented project requirements and vision
3. ‚úÖ Designed high-level architecture with decentralized approach
4. ‚úÖ Chose CRDTs (Yjs) for real-time collaboration
5. ‚úÖ Defined data models for notebooks, cells, and collaboration
6. ‚úÖ Created SQLite schema for persistence
7. ‚úÖ Implemented notebook command structure (`cmd/cyphernetes/notebook.go`)
8. ‚úÖ Built pkg/notebook package with:
   - Server implementation with Gin router
   - SQLite storage layer with full schema
   - Session manager for WebSocket connections
   - API handlers for notebook operations
   - Client for API interactions
   - Basic HTML interface for development

**Code Changes Made:**
- Created `cmd/cyphernetes/notebook.go` - CLI command structure
- Created `pkg/notebook/` package with:
  - `server.go` - HTTP server with WebSocket support
  - `models.go` - Data models and types
  - `store.go` - SQLite storage implementation
  - `session.go` - Real-time collaboration session management
  - `handlers.go` - API route handlers
  - `client.go` - API client for interactions
  - `static/index.html` - Temporary UI placeholder

**Dependencies Added:**
- `github.com/gorilla/websocket` - WebSocket support
- `github.com/mattn/go-sqlite3` - SQLite database driver

**Architecture Decisions:**
- Decentralized P2P approach with WireGuard
- Pin-code authentication (6-digit temporary codes)
- SQLite for notebook persistence
- Jupyter-style layout with flexible rows (1, 2, or 4 cells)
- WebSocket for real-time collaboration
- Embedded static files for the UI

**Next Steps:**
- Test basic notebook creation and API
- Implement query execution integration
- Add WireGuard peer-to-peer functionality
- Implement Y.js for real-time collaboration

**Issues Encountered:**
- Fixed compilation errors in handlers.go (unused imports, type conversion issues)
- Added missing `io/fs` import in server.go

**Major Milestone**: Complete notebook TypeScript project structure created following the same pattern as the existing web UI. The project now has:
- Backend: Complete Go server with SQLite storage, WebSocket support, and API endpoints
- Frontend: Complete React/TypeScript project with Vite build system
- Integration: Makefile updated to build both frontend and backend
- Architecture: All components properly integrated and ready for testing

**HUGE MILESTONE**: Query execution fully integrated! üéâ
- Created QueryExecutor that integrates with existing Cyphernetes core
- Implemented cell execution handler that runs actual Cyphernetes queries
- Added result storage and retrieval with SQLite persistence
- Updated frontend to handle cell updates and execution
- Full end-to-end query execution now working

**Query Execution Features**:
- Real Cyphernetes query parsing and execution
- Result storage in SQLite with JSON serialization
- Error handling for both parse and execution errors
- Cell update functionality for saving queries
- WebSocket broadcasting for real-time collaboration
- Support for different visualization types (JSON, YAML, Table, Graph)

## IMPORTANT BUILD INSTRUCTIONS

**ALWAYS use `make build` from the project root directory to build everything properly.**

- ‚úÖ `make build` - Builds web, notebook, and Go binary correctly
- ‚ùå `pnpm run build` directly - Doesn't copy files to the right places  
- ‚ùå `make notebook-build` individually - May not work from subdirectories
- ‚ùå `cd notebook && pnpm run build` - Doesn't integrate with the full build system

The Makefile handles all dependencies and file copying correctly. Always use it!
