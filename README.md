# Cyphernetes

Cyphernetes is a command-line interface (CLI) tool designed to manage Kubernetes resources using a query language inspired by Cypher, the query language of Neo4j. It provides a more intuitive way to interact with Kubernetes clusters, allowing users to express complex operations as graph-like queries.

## Why Cyphernetes?

Kubernetes management often involves dealing with complex and verbose command-line instructions. Cyphernetes simplifies this complexity by introducing a declarative query language that can express these instructions in a more readable and concise form. By leveraging a query language similar to Cypher, users can efficiently perform CRUD operations on Kubernetes resources, visualize resource connections, and manage their Kubernetes clusters with greater ease and flexibility.

## Usage

Cyphernetes offers two main commands: `quote` and `shell`. Below are examples of how to use these commands with different types of queries.

### Quote Command

The `quote` command is used for running single Cyphernetes queries from the command line. 

Example usage:

```bash
$ cyphernetes quote "MATCH (d:Deployment {name: 'nginx'}) RETURN d"
```

This command retrieves information about a Deployment named 'nginx'.

### Shell Command
The shell command launches an interactive shell where you can execute multiple queries in a session.

To start the shell:

```bash
cyphernetes shell
```
Within the shell, you can run queries interactively. Here are some examples:

### Basic Node Match

```graphql
MATCH (d:Deployment) RETURN d
```
This query lists all Deployment resources.

### Node with Properties

```graphql
MATCH (d:Deployment {app: 'nginx'}) RETURN d
```
Retrieves Deployments where the app label is 'nginx'.

### Multiple Nodes

```graphql
# With a relationship
MATCH (d:Deployment)->(s:Service) RETURN d, s

# Multiple matches
MATCH (d:Deployment), (s:Service) RETURN d, s
```
Lists Deployments and their associated Services.

### Node with Multiple Properties

```graphql
MATCH (s:Service {type: 'LoadBalancer', region: 'us-west'}) RETURN s.status.LoadBalancer
```
Finds Services of type 'LoadBalancer' in the 'us-west' region and returns their Load Balancer address.

Remember to type exit or press Ctrl-C to leave the shell.

## Development

Cyphernetes is written in Go and utilizes a parser generated by goyacc to interpret the custom query language.

### Prerequisites

- Go (1.16 or later)
- goyacc (for generating the parser)
- Make (for running make commands)

### Getting Started

To get started with development:

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/avitaltamir/cyphernetes.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd cyphernetes
    ```

### Building the Project

Use the Makefile commands to build the project:

- Test & Build:
    ```bash
    $ make
    ```
- To build the binary:
    ```bash
    make build
    ```

- To run tests:
    ```bash
    $ make test
    ```

- To generate the grammar parser:
    ```bash
    $ make gen-parser
    ```

- To clean up the build:
    ```bash
    $ make clean
    ```

## Project Roadmap

The project is at it's earliest milestone and supports performing GET operations.
The Cypher-like grammer implementation is incomplete, still missing:
* CREATE, SET, DELETE clauses
* Match clauses with more than 2 comma-separated Node patterns
* Match clauses with multiple relationship patterns
* Relationships between more than 2 nodes
* Relationships pattern tokens (relationship arrows are currently similar to commas)
  This will be required later when we introduce more complex K8s operations
