Cyphernetes turns this: 😣
```bash
# Select Deployments in all Namespaces which are scaled to zero,
# find all Ingresses routing into these deployments -
# finally for each Ingress change it's ingress class to 'inactive':

kubectl get deployments -A -o json | jq -r '.items[] | select(.spec.replicas == 0) | \
[.metadata.namespace, .metadata.name] | @tsv' | \
while read -r ns dep; do kubectl get services -n "$ns" -o json | \
jq -r --arg dep "$dep" '.items[] | select(.spec.selector.app == $dep) | .metadata.name' | \
while read -r svc; do kubectl get ingresses -n "$ns" -o json | jq -r --arg svc "$svc" '.items[] | \
select(.spec.rules[].http.paths[].backend.service.name == $svc) | .metadata.name' | \
xargs -I {} kubectl patch ingress {} -n "$ns" --type=json -p \
'[{"op": "replace", "path": "/spec/ingressClassName", "value": "inactive"}]'; done; done
```

Into this: 🤩 
```graphql
# Do the same thing!

MATCH (d:Deployment)->(s:Service)->(i:Ingress)
WHERE d.spec.replicas=0
SET i.spec.ingressClassName="inactive";
```

## How?

Cyphernetes is [Cypher](https://neo4j.com/developer/cypher/) repurposed for working with the Kubernetes API.
It is a mixture of ascii-art, SQL and JSON and it lets us express Kubernetes operations in an efficeint way that is also fun and creative.

### Examples
```graphql
MATCH (d:Deployment)
RETURN d.spec.replicas AS desiredReplicas, 
       d.status.availableReplicas AS runningReplicas;

{
  "d": [
    {
      "desiredReplicas": 2,
      "name": "coredns",
      "runningReplicas": 2
    }
  ]
}

Query executed in 9.081292ms
```

Cyphernetes' superpower is understanding the relationships between Kubernetes resource kinds.
This feature is expressed using the arrows (`->`) you see in the example queries.
Relationships let us express connected operations in a natural way, and without having to worry about the underlying Kubernetes API:

```graphql
# This is similar to `kubectl expose`
> MATCH (d:Deployment {name: "nginx"})
  CREATE (d)->(s:Service);

Created services/nginx

Query executed in 30.692208ms
```

### It has macros too
Macros are minimalistic, user-extensible & batteries included stored procedures.
They turn the Cyphernetes shell into a true kubectl alternative.
Many useful macros are included - and it's easy to define your own.

```graphql
# This macro creates a service and public ingress for a deployment.
# Cyphernetes can optionally draw a graph of affected nodes!

> :expose_public nginx foo.com
Created ingresses/nginx

┌─────────────────┐
│ *Ingress* nginx │
└─────────────────┘
  │
  │ :ROUTE
  ▼
┌─────────────────┐
│ *Service* nginx │
└─────────────────┘

{
  "ingresses": [
    {
      "Host": "foo.com",
      "Path": "/",
      "Service": "nginx",
      "name": "nginx"
    }
  ],
  "services": [
    {
      "ClusterIP": "10.96.164.152",
      "Type": "ClusterIP",
      "name": "nginx"
    }
  ]
}

## Get Cyphernetes

Using go:

```bash
go install github.com/avitaltamir/cyphernetes/cmd/cyphernetes@latest
```

Alternatively, grab a binary from the [Releases page](https://github.com/AvitalTamir/cyphernetes/releases).

## Development

Cyphernetes is written in Go and utilizes a parser generated by goyacc to interpret the custom query language.

### Prerequisites

* Go (1.16 or later)
* goyacc (for generating the parser)
* Make (for running make commands)

### Getting Started

To get started with development:

Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/avitaltamir/cyphernetes.git
```

Navigate to the project directory:

```bash
cd cyphernetes
```

### Building the Project

Use the Makefile commands to build the project:

* Build & Test:

```bash
make
```

* To build the binary:

```bash
make build
```

* To run tests:

```bash
make test
```

* To generate the grammar parser:

```bash
make gen-parser
```

* To clean up the build:

```bash
make clean
```
