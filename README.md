Cyphernetes is [Cypher](https://neo4j.com/developer/cypher/) repurposed for working with the Kubernetes API.

Cyphernetes is designed to translate quickly and with little friction **from whiteboard to code**.

A mixture of ascii-art, SQL-esque keywords and jsonPaths, Cyphernetes lets us express Kubernetes CRUD operations in an efficeint, creative and fun way.

Cyphernetes' superpower is that it understands the relationships between Kubernetes resource kinds.
This feature lets us express highly complex operations in a natural way, and without having to worry about the underlying Kubernetes API.

The more complicated an operation is, the shorter it's Cyphernetes representation would be compared to the equiavalent nested kubectl commands or API client code. Even highly complicated operations can usually be expressed in a single line of Cyphernetes.

## Install

```bash
go install github.com/avitaltamir/cyphernetes/cmd/cyphernetes@latest
```

## Usage

Please see the [Usage Instructions](https://github.com/AvitalTamir/cyphernetes/blob/main/USAGE.md) to learn how to use Cyphernetes.

## Development

Cyphernetes is written in Go and utilizes a parser generated by goyacc to interpret the custom query language.
